    <H3>Here are the mediums I prefer to use when creating art:</H3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Oil Paint
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I love using oil paint because of it's slow drying nature. It also blends well and makes it easier to paint realistic pictures.
        </li>
        <li>
          A downside of using oil paint would also haveto be it's slow drying nature - it takes longer to paint between layers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Watercolor
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I like using watercolor because it dries easily - paintings can be finished in the least amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          I think a downside of using this medium would be that it allows for few mistakes + framing your work's a hassle.
